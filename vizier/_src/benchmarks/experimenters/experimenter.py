"""Experimenter base class for problem statement and evaluation.

Experimenters represent black-box optimization problems.
Each experimenter defines a ProblemStatement, representing the search space and
the metrics it returns in Evaluate (via CompletedTrials).

Pseudo-code for using Experimenters with Vizier Designers:

exp = ExperimenterSubClass(...)  # Possibly configure the experimenter.
problem_statement = exp.problem_statement()
designer = Designer(problem_statement)  # Configure the search algorithm
for i in range(10):
  suggestions = designer.suggest(count=2)
  completed_trials = exp.evaluate(suggestions)
  designer.update(completed_trials)
